Architecture
============

To create rooms, access rooms and stream within existing rooms, you have to
contact Nuve server.

Nuve server is responsible for storing information about rooms, as well as
managing access to them.

For the time being, the Nuve server is separate from Peer Instruction
application.  I hope to incorporate it into the application in the future.
